                <h3>About The Gost of Sparta</h3>
                <p>Born as a Spartan, Kratos was raised to be a warrior. His deeds as general caught the attention of
                    the gods and when he was about to lose to the Barbarian Army, Ares, the former god of war, offered
                    him power in exchange of his loyalty.</p>
                <p>Kratos served Ares without ever questioning his orders, until the day he was sent to slaughter a
                    small village. The second he killed the last two women he realized he was tricked, he had just
                    killed his wife and doughter. For that day and beyond he was cursed to cary on his skin the ashes of
                    his beloved ones. He became the Ghost of Sparta and swore revenge on the god who had deceived him.
                </p>
                <p>Upon taking his revenge, Kratos was chosen to replace Ares and became the new god of war. At least
                    until Zeus, god of thunder and leader of Olympus, deceives Kratos once more, fearing that one day he
                    would might end his reign. Kratos sets out again to seek revenge and nothing, not even the discovery
                    that he was Zeus's son, could stop him. Not until all the gods of Olympus were dead.</p>
                <p>Many years have passed and now Kratos lives a peaceful life with his new wife, Laufey, and his son,
                    Athreus, in the Nordic region. When his wife dies for unknown causes, she leaves behind instructions
                    to Kratos and Athreus, that both should cremate her body and spread the ashes at the highest
                    mountain on the nine realms. Before they could leave for the journey ahead, Kratos is attacked by a
                    stranger, and thus starting the events that would lead to Ragnarök</p>
                <p>Of course, Kratos it is not a real person, rather a fictional character from the series of games God
                    of War. Developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, the first
                    game was released in 2005 and up to this day counts with 8 games in total. <a
